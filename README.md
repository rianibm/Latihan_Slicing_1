# Latihan_Slicing_1
Fsw synrgy

Made with bootstrap 5.3 for daily practice in bootcamp.
This website is just a replication from https://www.binaracademy.com/binarx/synrgyacademy , because I'm too tired to find another hehe.
I just change the color, with syrngy logo.

Currently still replacing bootstrap utilities like color etc manually in css, later on (if im not tired and busy enough, im gonna practice my sass).
